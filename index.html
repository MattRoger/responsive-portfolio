			<p>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular
				''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark
				wizards.</p>
			<p>When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then
				later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women
				on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>
			<p>As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Oh no! The professor will hit me!
				But if Zoidberg 'fixes' itâ€¦ then perhaps gifts! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I
				may blackmail them later.</p>
